JPerf picked up where Perf4J left off, and the intention is to continue with new features and bug fixes that are long over due.\r\n\r\nReleases are pushed to the central maven repository and can be included in maven builds like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.github.sovaa</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>jperf</artifactId>\r\n    <version>0.9.19</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork and send pull-requests.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
