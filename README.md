Performance Monitoring and Statistics for Java Code

JPerf is a fork of the abandoned Perf4J project which hasn't made a release since 2011 and no commits since 2012. JPerf picked up where Perf4J left off, and the intention is to continue with new features and bug fixes that are long over due.

Releases are pushed to the central maven repository and can be included in maven builds like this:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.sovaa</groupId>
    <artifactId>jperf</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.19</version>
</dependency>
```

Feel free to fork and send pull-requests.
